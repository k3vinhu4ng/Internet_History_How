                <h2>HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)</h2>

                <p>
                    HTTP is an acronym for Hypertext Transfer Protocol. In laymen terms, HTTP can be thought of as the language used to communicate between web browsers and servers.
                </p>

                <p>
                    How do computers communicate with each other? When we use the web browser, we often type in a web address in a URL, or Uniform Resource Locator. After we press enter for the web address we just entered in the URL, our computer starts to communicate with another computer called server in a language called HTTP, or Hypertext Transfer Protocol. HTTP can be commonly thought of as the language used to communicate between web browsers and servers.
                </p>

                <p>
                    HTTP works by using GET requests. Web browsers will use HTTP to send a GET request to a server. For example, if we want to load the home page for a certain website, we are sending a GET request to the website’s server for the HTML code of the website’s homepage. HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language and is responsible for a website’s appearance. HTML determines things such as the text, images, and structure of the website. Images and videos, however, are not directly included in the HTML text and require separate GET requests in order to be displayed on the webpage. When we send data to websites, such as by logging into a certain website, we are using HTTP to send a POST request to the website’s server.

                <h2>HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure)</h2>

                <p>
                    HTTPS stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure and is a more secure version of HTTP. Because information is sent in plain text over the Internet, our confidential data is vulnerable to hackers. Safe websites, however, use HTTPS, which asks our web browser to communicate on a secure channel using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) to provide security for our information and data. SSL and TLS are active when there is a lock icon next to the “https” part of the URL. Furthermore, digital certificates are issued by trusted entities that verify the identities of websites. If a website does not have a proper digital certificate, the web browser will warn the user.
