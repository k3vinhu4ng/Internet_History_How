                <p>
                    The invention of the internet completely altered the trajectory of the
                    human race, “it is on par with the wheel, fire, language, the printing
                    press.” From a computer as big as a room to millions and millions of
                    websites and computers connected around the world. In short, the internet
                    was born from a domino effect created by the space race between the Soviets
                    and the United States. Dwight D. Eisenhower created ARPA in 1958, the Advanced
                    Research Projects Agency to keep up with the Soviets. NASA later stepped up to
                    the plate, but the creation of ARPA helped deploy the first bare-bones
                    internet in 1969. At first, it was to reduce redundancy, instead of opening
                    up three terminals to work on three computers, it was better to open up just
                    one terminal to talk to all three computers. Many graduates students, and
                    researchers, and of course, ARPA wanted to create a network that would allow
                    communication between computers in different places. The big challenge was
                    how information should be sent over the network of computers. Paul Baran came
                    up with the idea of breaking up the information into small packets that would
                    be sent across different nodes of computers. Each packet contained information
                    like where it came from, what it contained, and where it was going. At first,
                    computers were only able to communicate between other computers on the sam

                <h2>First Applications</h2>

                <p>
                    The first-ever form of the internet was a network established between
                    a couple of universities across the United States, called the ARPA
                    network. Leonard Kleinrock, an MIT grad student applied the queuing
                    theory on data transmission, and it is what the ARPA network used.
                    Queuing theory is simply a system in which something arrives somewhere,
                    then goes on to the next destination, similar to an envelope in the mail,
                    which goes through different post offices until it reaches its destination.
                    This data transmission was implemented using the demand access technique and
                    distributed control. This meant that data was only sent through nodes
                    depending on how urgent it was, and no node had supreme control over
                    the entire network.
