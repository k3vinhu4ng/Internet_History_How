                <h2>IP Addresses</h2>

                <p>
                    A computer’s address is referred to as the IP Address, short for Internet Protocol Addresses. IP addresses are a string of digits, similar to a phone number, and they allow devices to communicate with each other. Original IP addresses used Internet Protocol version4, or IPv4, which defines an IP address as a 32-bit number. This allowed for around 4 billion unique IP addresses. However, the Internet grew in popularity and there was a need for more IP addresses. To fix this solution, a new version called IPv6, or Internet Protocol version 6, now uses 128 bits for the IP address. This allows for around 340 undecillion unique addresses. To put this into perspective, this is enough IP addresses for every grain of sand on earth.

                <h2>Data Packets</h2>

                <p>
                    Packets refer to the way IP addresses communicate with each other. Because most data exchange on the Internet consists of large files, the data is sent in separate parts called packets. These packets can be thought of as cars that can transport different objects. Like cars, packets can also transfer different types of files, such as music, e-book, and video files. Furthermore, most files are too large to fit into one packet. Instead, files are divided up and sent separately in packets. To illustrate this concept, imagine transporting a space shuttle by taking it apart and putting into separate trucks to transport it to a certain location. The trucks in this scenario would represent what packets are to data.

                <h2>Routing</h2>

                <p>
                    Data also doesn’t travel directly to its designated location. Instead, data travels in different paths, much like how cars may sometimes take different roads to reach the same destination. Moreover, the packets of the data can also take different paths to reach the same address. The path the data takes is usually the cheapest available path. In this case, cheapest does not necessarily mean cost but rather refers to the time, politics, and relationships between companies.
                </p>

            <p>
                One important thing to know is that because packets can take multiple different routes to get to a certain address, this makes the Internet more reliable because it is fault tolerant. Fault tolerant means that in case one path is interrupted, there are many other paths that allow the data to be transmitted.
