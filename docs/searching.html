                <h2>The Start of Online Searching</h2>
                <p>
                    When the word wide web was just an infant, there was no way of typing something into a search bar and getting relevant information. You would have to traverse the web by continuously clicking links until you arrived at what you were looking for, making the world wide web utterly useless. But along came some great minds from Stanford University that completely changed the internet forever.
                </p>

                <p>
                    To start, two Stanford University students, David Filo and Jerry Yang were one day scouring the internet looking for relevant information on sports for their fantasy basketball team. They came across the idea that the internet should be easily searchable. They launched their website Yahoo that simply broke the internet into categories, and they spent hours looking at websites choosing in which category they belonged to. This caught the attention of some venture capitalists, because Yahoo was getting lots of traffic to their site. Venture CApitalists obviously want to make money, so they urged Yahoo to put advertisements on their page. The founders were skeptical at first, so they tested it out with small banner ads. Their users did not complain so they put out even more advertisements. Yahoo was also competing with another website called Excite. The competition was fierce. If one company released a feature, so did the other. Those companies soon lost sight of why they were created in the first place, as a search engine. Their searching capabilities were poor because they just showed websites that matched specific words.

                <h2>The Beginnings of Google</h2>

                <p>
                    Larry Page and Sergey Brin, who were also students from Stanford University, came up with a clever way to search the Internet. They figured that if a specific webpage with specific keywords was linked to other websites, it meant that the page in question was relevant. The more websites pointed to another, the more relevant it became. This made results while searching the internet far more relevant. They soon began looking for an investment to keep their startup going. They asked many venture capitalists, and many turned them down. They didn't want to invest in another search engine that did the same thing, they missed out on an investment of a lifetime. While Larry Page and Sergey Brin were looking for investments, they had a meeting with a rival search engine, Excite. Google offered Excite the entire company for a measly 1 million dollars! Google as of February 2021 is worth almost 1.4 trillion dollars.
