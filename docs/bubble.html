                <h2>The Start of E-Commerce</h2>
                <p>
                    E-commerce refers to the buying and selling of products on online services over the Internet. During the 1990s, companies started to use the World Wide Web as a means of conducting business. This was a revolutionary change in the way businesses were conducted and had a significant impact on the way the economy operated.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Two notable companies that started doing e-commerce during the 1990s were Amazon and Ebay. Jeff Bezos had analytical experience from his time on Wall Street and he used this knowledge to start his company online Amazon in the summer of 1995. Bezos reasoned that e-commerce allowed for a bookstore with millions of titles, which is impossible in a physical setting. Around the same time, Pierre Omidyar, who was an idealistic software programmer at the time, had an interesting idea that would eventually become what is known as Ebay. Like Jeff Bezos, Pierre Omidyar thought of the web as a place to conduct business. Despite this similarity, these two were quite different. Jeff Bezos focused his business plan heavily on market research and methodical analysis. Pierre Omidar, however, did not have a business plan or any market research and he was simply a humble software coder who thought that the idea of making an online auction site sounded pretty cool.

                <h2>Success and Revolution</h2>

                <p>
                    These two companies immediately saw some measure of success after launching. P ierre Omidar was earning thousands of dollars in fees within the first thirty days. Within months, Amazon had shipped books to 45 different countries and all 50 US states. In fact, Amazon had to discard their original business plan which considered slow growth and “replant everything because the early customers were really taking onto the service very quickly.”
                </p>

            <p>
                The success of these two companies and how fast the web was spreading were soon noticed on Wall Street. To take into account the speed of internet growth, it took 38 years before 50 million people were using radio after it was invented. With television, it took 13 years. However, once the Internet was opened up to the general public, it took just 4 years before it had 50 million users. The growth of the Internet can be attributed to Moore’s Law, which states that the speed and power of integrated circuits from microprocessors to memory chips doubles every 18 months. This allows for exponential growth in technology and it explains why our computers are no longer the size of entire rooms. Another important law that played an important role in the Internet exponential growth was known as Metcalfe’s law. Metcalfe’s law states that every new user increases the Internet’s usefulness dramatically. For example, between a hundred users there would be almost 5,000 possible pairs of users. As the number of users increase, the possible number of connections grows exponentially.

                <p>
                    Furthermore, the success of ecommerce can be attributed to the invention of public key cryptography. Developed by California based mathematicians Whitfield Diffie, Martin Hellman, and Ralph Merkle, public key cryptography allowed users to safely and securely use their credit card information over the internet. Fundamentally, public key cryptography prevented credit card numbers from being intercepted over the Internet.

                <h2>Overspeculation Leads to Dot Com Bubble</h2>

                <p>
                    The success of Amazon and Ebay inspired legions of imitators across the country. Soon, ecommerce was considered the new Gold Rush and new ecommerce websites soon flooded the market. With these new businesses also came new expectations from investors on Wall Street. E-commerce seemed like the next big thing and Wall Street made sure to back many of these newly made Internet companies. However, unlike Amazon and Ebay, these new companies lacked any real or successful business model. They were not successful despite having expensively designed websites. Many investors knew this, but they still invested in these companies in the off chance that one of these companies became successful. Eventually, all the growth caused by the speculation of Internet companies crashed in what is known as the Dot Com Bubble. The Dot Com bubble crash of 2000 and 2001 saw around $3.5 trillion of paper wealth disappear. This led to the Nasdaq to lose more than two-thirds of its value.

                <p>
                    False speculations caused a lot of people to lose a lot of money. As a result, New York’s Attorney General Eliot Spitzer “launched a crusade to reform the IPO industry and punish its post villains.” His most famous target was Martha Steward. Coming in second was Henry Blodgett, who in his emails admitted that many ecommerce companies were garbage but still encouraged people to invest in them. However, although many companies failed, the few companies that were successful ultimately transformed the economy.
