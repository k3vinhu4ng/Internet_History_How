                <h2>Domain Names</h2>

                <p>
                    Domain Names like Facebook.com or Google.com can be thought of as just variables used to name an IP address. It’s easier to remember Facebook.com than 69.63.184.142. The internet is a huge network of computers all trying to communicate with each other. When you type in Google.com, that information is sent to a DNS server that receives your ip address and returns the IP address of Google.com. In this way, your computer knows the address of Google.com, and can now connect with its servers using the address previously provided.

                </p>

                <p>
                    IPv4 is the 32-bit naming convention that is currently used for designating an address to a computer, like this: 69.63.184.142. It was designed in 1973 and adopted in the 1980s. The only drawback is that there are only 4 billion addresses that can be made. This is why The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, ICANN, is slowly pushing the internet into using IPv6, which looks like this: 2341:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334. IPv6 uses 128 bits per address and provides 340 undecillion unique addresses, that’s 66 zeroes!

                <h2>The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN)</h2>

                <p>
                    ICANN is a nonprofit created in September 1998 and is in charge of preventing the domains from having the
                    same IP address. They do not control the internet, they simply keep the
                    distribution of IP addresses under control so the internet runs smoothly. The acronym ICANN stands
                    for The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers.

                <h2>Domain Name System (DNS)</h2>

                <p>
                    Domain Name System, commonly known as DNS, is the system in which a domain name like www.example.com is given an IP address like, 190.63.184.142. When you want to go to example.com, your computer requests the IP address of example.com from a DNS server. If that DNS server doesn’t know the IP address of example.com, then it’ll communicate with other DNS servers until the IP address can be returned to your computer. This way your computer can communicate with example.com. Since one DNS server can’t possibly contain all IP addresses, it is split up between many DNS servers, some of which only handle .org, or .com, or .edu domain names. The Domain Name System was created to be an open and public communication protocol, for governments and educational institutions. But this openness has its downside. A DNS server can be hacked, and be made to return a different IP address for a certain domain, this is called DNS spoofing. Instead of going to the real google.com, DNS spoofing can send you to a mockup of google and you can become vulnerable by thinking a fake website is actually real.
