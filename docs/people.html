                <h2>Changes in Society</h2>
                <p>
                    The Internet not only changed the way businesses operate, but it also changed the way people interact with each other. A new generation of businesses allowed people to interact and exchange ideas like never before. Companies like Youtube, MySpace, and Facebook gave individual people the power to share their ideas and thoughts to millions of others. Traditionally, this type of exposure was only granted to large media companies. Now, people looked towards the web for knowledge and insight that is based on the wisdom of crowds.

                <h2>Digital Services</h2>

                <p>
                    Many web services started appearing that had revolutionary changes on society. In 1999, Shawn Fanning wrote a program called Napster that allowed people to share music files. Eventually this caught the attention of music labels and artists like Dr. Dre and Metallica. By 2001, Napster was forced to shut down for violating copyright laws. However, this created a shift where music started to be sold and shared on the Internet; this would make record stores become obsolete. Furthermore, Napster influenced companies like Apple to create their own music sharing programs, such as iTunes. Founded in 2005, YouTube was another revolutionary site that allowed people to exchange ideas. YouTube was a video sharing website that allowed people to post and share videos online. YouTube was so successful that it was eventually funded and bought out by Google in 2006. Furthermore, YouTube was also posed a threat to big media and faced a $1 billion from Viacom for disregarding intellectual property laws.

                <h2>Social Media</h2>

                <p>
                    Many other companies in what is known was the web 2.0 revolutionary changed the way society operated. Two notable social media companies were MySpace and Facebook. Founded by Tom Anderson in 2003, MySpace became the largest social media networking site in the world from 2005 to 2008. MySpace at one point even surpassed Google in its users. In 2004, Facebook was founded by Mark Zuckerberg and this social media platform was a direct competitor against MySpace. While MySpace was the largest social media platform at the time, Facebook’s users grew rapidly and eventually became the largest social media platform in the world. The introduction of social media into society ultimately created a world where people got substantial information from the web and developed online identities.                </p>

                <p>
                    Like how YouTube and Napster, many new websites began to disrupt traditional industries. Founded by Craig Newmark, a website called Craiglist allowed people to list classified ads on the Internet, which had a significant impact on the newspaper industry. Many websites, such as blogs, that were founded were also focused on freedom of communication, rather than profits. One example is Wikipedia, which is a non-profit website that aims at sharing valid information.
