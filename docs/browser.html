                <h2>Browser Wars</h2>
                <p>
                    Back in the early 1990s the world wide web, created by Tim Berners Lee was just a collection of webpages that contained nothing but line after line of text. There was also no way to find something easily, and the web was mostly used by scientists and researchers. This inspired Mark Andreessen, a student from the University of Illinois, to create a web browser that could be used by the general public and that was user-friendly. After he released his browser, Mosaic, within nine months, one million people had downloaded the Mosaic web browser and were actively using it. This caught the attention of a wealthy tech investor, James Clark. James Clark knew that with the incredible reach Mark’s web browser had, it could be a worthwhile investment. James Clark gave Mark a business proposition and offered him a full-time job in order to monetize Mosaic. Mark, who hadn’t even graduated from college at the time, took the offer which soon began the browser wars.

                <p>
                    The company known as Netscape was funding the browser and growing rapidly. This sparked Microsoft’s curiosity. Microsoft, at the time, being the company that had a monopoly over the operating system almost every single computer used, began to feel threatened. Bill Gates was notorious for destroying any company that posed a threat to his empire. Netscape later released its Navigator Browser and that’s when Microsoft began its sketchy practices. The Navigator Browser was an instant success and Microsoft wanted to put an end to that. Microsoft and Netscape had a meeting and offered Netscape a one-time fee of one million dollars for access to all of their technologies. Netscape obviously said no, and Bill Gates sent out a memo to his employees that they were basically going to copy Netscape and drive them out of business. One of Microsoft Sketchy tactics was sending its so-called secret salesman to these large companies that used computers running the Microsoft operating system. They then came up with terms that simply said, if they were to download and use Netscape Browser, their Microsoft licenses would be revoked. Businesses could not give up using Microsoft because it was basically the only Operating System available

                <h2>The Rise of Internet Explorer</h2>

                <p>
                    Netscape went public on Wall Street, and James Clark said his initial investment of five million dollars turned into about 600 million dollars. Netscape at this point felt extremely powerful, Mark Andreessen even geekily insulted Microsoft.

                    Microsoft went on to release its own browser called Internet Explorer and offered it for free, which was a game-changer in the browser wars. Netscape was charging people to download its browser. Microsoft having billions of dollars in revenue decided to take a small financial loss by offering its web browser for free, and ultimately drove Netscape out of business. This led the United States Government to file an antitrust lawsuit against Microsoft and was ultimately found guilty, forcing Microsoft to break into two companies. Unfortunately, it was too late and Netscape was ceased to exist. Soon after the Federal Appeals court determined the verdict was too harsh and rescinded the order to split the company in two.
